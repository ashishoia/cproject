Hello everyone,

I am pleased to present my C project, which focuses on various topics related to data structures. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of data structures and their implementation in C. Throughout the project, I have explored different data structures and included several questions to test your knowledge. Let's dive into the details!

Introduction to Data Structures:

What is a data structure?
Why are data structures important in programming?
Types of data structures and their characteristics.

Arrays:
Explanation of arrays and their basic operations.
How to declare and initialize an array.
Examples illustrating array manipulation.
Array-related questions to solve.

Linked Lists:
Overview of linked lists and their advantages over arrays.
Singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list.
Insertion, deletion, and traversal operations on linked lists.
Linked list-based questions for practice.

Conclusion:
Summary of the project and key takeaways.
Importance of data structures in efficient programming.
Encouragement to continue exploring advanced data structures.
I hope this project provides a comprehensive understanding of data structures in C. Feel free to explore the topics, attempt the included questions, and deepen your knowledge in this crucial aspect of programming. Happy learning and coding!
